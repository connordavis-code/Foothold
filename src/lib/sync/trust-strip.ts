import type { SourceHealth } from '@/lib/db/queries/health';

/**
 * Derived view-model for the dashboard trust strip. Pure — no DB,
 * no side effects. Consumes `getSourceHealth` output and reduces it
 * to one of three shapes the strip renders.
 *
 * Three states by precedence:
 *
 *   1. `elevated` — any source is `degraded`, `failed`, or
 *      `needs_reconnect`. The strip surfaces the offenders by name.
 *
 *   2. `no_signal` — every source is non-elevated AND no source has
 *      a successful sync timestamp yet (brand-new connections,
 *      pre-first-sync). Strip shows "Sync pending."
 *
 *   3. `healthy` — every source is non-elevated AND at least one has
 *      a `lastSuccessfulSyncAt`. Strip shows "Fresh X ago · N sources."
 *      `freshAt` is the OLDEST among per-source `lastSuccessfulSyncAt`
 *      values — the conservative reading: "as of this point, every
 *      tracked source had reported in." Using the newest would flatter
 *      ("synced 2 minutes ago!") even when other sources are 12 hours
 *      old.
 *
 * `stale` and `unknown` per-source states are intentionally silent
 * here, mirroring the `<StatePill>` rule in `<SourceHealthRow>`:
 * neither demands user action. They count toward the source total
 * but don't trigger the elevated branch.
 *
 * The `empty` case (no sources connected) is handled by the
 * dashboard's existing `<EmptyState>`, so the trust strip never has
 * to render zero sources.
